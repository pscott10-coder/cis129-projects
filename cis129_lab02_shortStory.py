print("There once were three little pig cyborgs.")
print("They one day decided to leave their planet Sizzlebacon, on ships they created.")
print("The first one left on a ship made of Porcine Alloy, which was not that strong but looked cool.")
print("The second pig left on a ship fabricated from Hamium, which was a little stronger but was still mainly for the asthetics.")
print("The last pig left on a ship constructed from the very rare and strong Baconite.")
print("As they left a Pork Hole opened up, the first and second pigs ships failed them, but the last pig got away.")
print("The moral of the story is, never underestimate the power of Bacon.")
